/**
 * This file previously contained the useNumberInput hook for working with NumberInput component.
 * It was designed to work with both standalone and react-hook-form integration.
 * 
 * The hook has been removed as part of code cleanup since it was not being used anywhere.
 * Direct imports of NumberInput from @/components/ui/number-input are used instead.
