/**
 * This file previously contained an Event Bus implementation for centralized pub/sub events.
 * 
 * Both eventBus instance and EVENT_NAMES constant have been removed as part of code cleanup
 * since they weren't being used anywhere in the application. The system now uses either
 * React's context API or more specific event handling like React Query's cache invalidation
 * for state management and updates.
